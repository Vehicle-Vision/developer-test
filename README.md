## Exercises

### Exercise One (PHP)

The `LeagueTable` class tracks the score of each player in a league. After each game, the player records their score with the `recordResult` function. 

The player's rank in the league is calculated using the following logic:

- The player with the highest score is ranked first (rank 1).
- The player with the lowest score is ranked last.
- If two players are tied on score, then the player who has played the fewest games is ranked higher.
- If two players are tied on score and number of games played, then the player who was first in the list of players is ranked higher.

[ ] Implement the `playerRank` function that returns the player at the given rank.

*Don't forget it should work if the scores are changed too.*

### Exercise Two (CSS)

[ ] Make the  sidebar (aside) fit as expected on the right. *Hint - It just needs a tweak.*  
[ ] Make the footer be positioned at the bottom but not overlap the content when the window is smaller in height.

### Exercise Three (Forms)

[ ] Build a simple form that accepts a URL.  
[ ] Use PHP to query a URL (example below) and pass back the size of the URL in MB.

Example URL to query:  
https://apps.vehicle-vision.com/sales/app/files/android135/vv_sales.apk

### Exercise Four (HTML)

[ ] Fix the mistakes in the HTML.

### Exercise Five (Javascript)

Using jQuery, implement the setup function that registers a click event handler and implements the following:

[ ] When the button of class remove is clicked, its parent `<div>` element should be removed from the gallery.

### Exercise Six (MySQL)

There are 3 mistakes in the MySQL query.

[ ] Document the 3 mistakes and what you would do to fix them

*They are general mistakes i.e. you do not need DB access to spot them.*
